- CSS: Used for styling and presentation of the website.
- SHA256: Passwords are hashed using the SHA256 algorithm for enhanced security.

## Next Steps for Improvement
- Nurse Management: Integrate a feature to manage nurses in the system. This can include functionalities such as adding and updating nurse profiles, tracking their availability and shift schedules, and assigning them to specific rooms or departments.
- Shift Management: Develop a shift management feature to facilitate the scheduling and tracking of shifts for nurses. This feature should allow administrators to create and manage shift schedules, assign nurses to specific shifts, and ensure proper coverage for each department or unit.
- Room Assignment: Implement a room assignment feature for nurses, enabling administrators to assign nurses to specific rooms or patient assignments. This will help ensure efficient patient care and streamline communication between nurses and patients.
